Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my restaurant Bodogami in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript stack to create my own solutions for my business
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned my first name only when I was 6 years old, because I heard my teacher asking my mom my name.
